    Compare the content and correctness of the submitted python code with the expert answer. Ignore any differences in whitespace, style, and escape characters.
    The submitted answer may either be correct or incorrect. Determine which case applies. Answer the question by responding with one of the following:
      "Correct": The submitted Python will be functionally similar to the expert given code.
      "Incorrect": The submitted Python and the expert answer are functionally different, i.e. they do not yield the same result when run, even after accounting for superficial differences, or the submitted Python code will result in an error when run.
